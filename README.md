- 👋 Hi, I’m Luka
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in frontend development in Angular. Backend development with Java, Spring boot and MySQL are also in scope of my interest.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to enhance my knowledge of Angular features and implement them using best practices both in my professional and personal projects.

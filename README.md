- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luka, Junior Frontend developer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in frontend development using popular frameworks like Angular and React. Backend development with Node.js, Express, Java, Spring boot and MySQL are also in scope of my interest.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to enhance my knowledge of Angular features and implement them using best practices both in my professional and personal projects.
